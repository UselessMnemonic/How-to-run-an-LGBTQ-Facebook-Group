                     My problems and possible soutions to ownership of traditonal LGBTQ+ Facebook groups.

Definitions
Owner: a person or few people that have full digital control of everything that happens on the Facebook group.


#1 Ownership

- Explanation:
  - A Facebook group is like a digital town square.
  - You can’t simply have 1 or a few people own the entire thing. That is a dictatorship.
    - Furthermore the often ownership is not diverse.
  - Diverse ownership
    - Not all people who are friends or will automatically agree with whatever another owner does.
    - What letter of the LGBTQ+ are they?
    - Age
    - Ethnic background
    - Economic income bracket
    - Education level 
    - Etc






#2 Political structure

- Right now most Facebook groups are owned by just a few people
  - That is a dictatorship
- Picking a better political structure 
  - Elected representatives/owners
    - Not ideal for many reasons
      - Need I explain the current state of America? America is very corrupt. 
        Right now unlimited campaign contributions for politicians from mega corporations and billionaires is 
        considered “free speech” by the Supreme Court.
    - Easy to implement
- Decentralized direct democracy 
  - Every “verified” user owns a piece of the group. Likely a crypto token?
    - Maybe something with an expiry date to prevent inactive or bad faith users from participating.
  - Ideas/venues/choices are voted on directly using a poll  or app
    - Must use rank-choice voting.
